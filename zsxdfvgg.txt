About me: I decided last year to switch careers and find new challenges in web development. I completed a 9 week intensive, full-stack bootcamp and have been working on personal projects and other courses since then. My work background is quite diverse: tech support, online advertising, campaign and account management and more. Learning and taking on challenges is something that drives me, and I believe I've chosen an excellent field to pursue. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.
