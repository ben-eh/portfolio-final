In 2018 I decided to leave my job to pursue a new career and new challenges
in web development. It started with Le Wagon's 9 week bootcamp and since then
I've continued to build on that knowledge and go beyond. I'm quite comfortable with
Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, relational databases, git/github and I'm working on learning
more Javascript and PHP. I'm currently looking for an employment opportunity in web development
where I would be able to improve upon my existing skills and learn as much as possible from
veteran developers. My professional background is quite varied and I can bring a lot to the table,
and I look forward to doing just that.

            use those skills and improve upon my existing skills and learn from veteran developpers.
